# Deploying and Managing a T-Pot Honeypot

## Objective

I set up a T-Pot honeypot to detect and analyze malicious activities by simulating vulnerable systems. T-Pot, developed by the Deutsche Telekom Security Team, integrates several honeypots and analysis tools, making it a comprehensive solution for cybersecurity research and threat intelligence. 

* Detect and log various types of cyber attacks in real-time.
* Analyze attack patterns and techniques used by adversaries.
* Enhance my understanding of honeypot deployment and management.

### Skills Learned

* **Network Security and Monitoring:** Understanding of how to monitor and secure networks, detecting and analyzing malicious activities in real-time.
* **Vulnerability Assessment and Management:** Ability to identify and assess vulnerabilities using various honeypot tools, and implementing remediation strategies.
* **Incident Response and Threat Analysis:** Skills in responding to security incidents and analyzing threats through forensic analysis of captured data.
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Proficiency in collecting, analyzing, and visualizing security data using tools like Kibana and Elasticsearch.
* **System Administration and Automation:** Enhanced skills in deploying and managing virtual machines, configuring network settings, and automating maintenance tasks.
